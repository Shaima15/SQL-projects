**2- Bike Data analysis and Dashboard creation**

This project involved creating a new database and importing 3 Excel files into it which were later combined into one table using 'cte', 'union', and 'joins'. Then, the SQL file was imported into PowerBI to create a dynamic dashboard to help the organization answer the below:

**3- Netflix Data Analysis and Visualization**

This ELT project used Python, SQL, and Power BI to clean, analyze, and visualize the dataset to provide insights using a dynamic dashboard.

**Python:**
- Extracted data and loaded it using sqlalchemy library to connect Jupyter Notebook with MS SQL Server 

**SQL:**
- Created CTE to help with removing duplicates 
- Created new tables using the cross apply clause and ‘string split’ to normalize the data and allow further analysis 
- Populated null values using insights derived by mapping two columns
- Wrote queries to answer various business questions 

**Power BI:** 
- Imported the tables from MS SQL Server to Power BI and created various visuals that provided some of the following insights: 

a) Total Movies and TV shows by release year
b) Top 10 countries by Movies and TV shows
c) Genre by total titles
